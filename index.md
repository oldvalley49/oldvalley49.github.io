I am an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University, studying Applied Mathematics & Statistics and Computer Science with a minor in Music. 

My academic and research interests center on developing mathematical and computational methods to make sense of complex, noisy data.

I currently work with [Hongkai Ji](https://jilab.org/) in the Department of Biostatistics, working on perturbation modeling and multimodal integration for single-cell and spatial omics data. I am also part of [Steven Salzberg](https://salzberg-lab.org/)'s group in the Department of Computer Science, developing combinatorial optimization methods for interpreting DNA sequence data. 

Alongside my studies, I have collaborated with [iVoted](https://www.ivotedconcerts.org/), a non-profit that leverages music to increase voter turnout in the U.S. There, I developed a data-driven concert scheduling process that helped maximize the organizationâ€™s civic impact.

During my free time, I like to play the piano. Some of my recordings are available [here](/music).
