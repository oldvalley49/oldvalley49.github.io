### Notebooks
I’m exploring a selection of mathematical/machine learning topics that are relevant to my current research and personal interests.
I’ve posted some of my notes here, which include mathematical or algorithmic formulations, along with some ideas I wanted to experiment with. 

* [Graph Signal Processing](/posts/graph_signal_processing/)
    + Deriving the graph Laplacian, introducing the Graph Fourier Transform, and trying it on image processing and spatial transcriptomics data.
